# AI Ethics & Compliance Platform User Guide

This guide provides detailed instructions for using the AI Ethics & Compliance Platform running on AWS Fargate.

## Overview

The AI Ethics & Compliance Platform offers a comprehensive suite of tools for monitoring, analyzing, and ensuring compliance with ethics guidelines and regulatory requirements for AI systems. The platform consists of six interconnected microservices, each handling a specific aspect of compliance management.

## Accessing the Platform

The platform is accessible through a REST API exposed via the Application Load Balancer. The base URL follows this format:

```
https://compliance-platform.example.com/api/v1/
```

Replace `compliance-platform.example.com` with your actual domain or the ALB DNS name provided during setup.

## Authentication

All API requests require authentication using AWS IAM credentials. Use AWS Signature Version 4 to sign your requests. Most AWS SDKs handle this automatically.

Example with AWS CLI:

```bash
aws configure set region us-east-1
aws configure set aws_access_key_id YOUR_ACCESS_KEY
aws configure set aws_secret_access_key YOUR_SECRET_KEY

# Example API call using signed request
aws lambda invoke \
  --function-name compliance-api-proxy \
  --payload '{"path": "/api/v1/regulations", "httpMethod": "GET"}' \
  output.json
```

## Python SDK

For simplified integration, you can use our Python SDK:

```python
from compliance_platform import CompliancePlatformClient

# Initialize the client
client = CompliancePlatformClient(
    api_url="https://compliance-platform.example.com/api/v1",
    aws_region="us-east-1"
)

# Get regulatory updates
updates = client.regulatory_intelligence.get_updates(region="EU", category="ai-governance")

# Perform ethics assessment
assessment = client.ethics.assess_system(
    system_id="ai-system-123",
    system_name="Customer Segmentation AI",
    system_description="Machine learning system that groups customers based on behavior and demographics"
)

# Generate compliance report
report = client.reports.generate(
    report_type="compliance-overview",
    systems=["all"],
    time_period={"start": "2025-01-01", "end": "2025-03-31"},
    format="pdf"
)
```

## AWS Console Access

To monitor the platform through the AWS Console:

1. **ECS Console**: View the status of Fargate services and tasks
   - Go to Amazon ECS > Clusters > ai-compliance-prod
   - View services and their health status

2. **CloudWatch Logs**: View application logs
   - Go to CloudWatch > Log groups
   - Look for log groups starting with `/ecs/ai-compliance/`

3. **CloudWatch Metrics**: Monitor performance metrics
   - Go to CloudWatch > Metrics
   - Check ECS metrics for CPU/memory usage
   - Check ALB metrics for request counts and latency

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **API Authentication Failures**:
   - Verify that your AWS credentials are valid and have the necessary permissions
   - Check that your request signing is correct
   - Ensure your system clock is synchronized

2. **Service Unavailable Errors**:
   - Check the ECS service status in the AWS Console
   - View CloudWatch Logs for any application errors
   - Verify that the ALB target groups show healthy targets

3. **Missing or Incorrect Data**:
   - Verify that all required parameters are provided in your requests
   - Check that input formats match the expected formats
   - Examine application logs for any data processing errors

### Support

For additional assistance, contact support at compliance-support@example.com or open a support ticket through the internal ticketing system.

## Best Practices

1. **Regular Compliance Checks**:
   - Schedule weekly compliance assessments for all AI systems
   - Set up automated email reports for compliance status
   - Address high-severity issues within 48 hours

2. **Policy Management**:
   - Review all policies quarterly
   - Update policies when new regulations are published
   - Ensure all AI systems have associated compliance policies

3. **Integration**:
   - Integrate compliance checks into your CI/CD pipeline
   - Use the SDK to automatically validate compliance before deployments
   - Set up compliance gates that prevent deployment of non-compliant systems
