# AI Ethics & Compliance Platform

This platform provides AI-powered ethics and compliance capabilities for the AI Employee system, enabling continuous monitoring, analysis, and reporting on regulatory requirements and ethical guidelines across global jurisdictions.

## Key Features

- **Regulatory Intelligence**: Collect, classify, and organize regulatory information from official sources
- **Web Scraping & Monitoring**: Monitor official websites, news sources, and regulatory bodies for updates
- **Compliance Analysis**: Analyze company policies and operations against regulatory requirements
- **Ethics Assessment**: Evaluate AI systems against ethical guidelines and standards
- **Policy Management**: Create, manage, and version control organizational policies
- **Reporting & Dashboard**: Generate compliance reports and visualizations

## Installation

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Configuration

The platform requires the following environment variables:

```
REGULATION_BUCKET=ai-compliance-regulation-storage
COMPLIANCE_KNOWLEDGE_INDEX=compliance-knowledge-index
```

## Usage Example

```python
from compliance_platform import RegulatoryIntelligence, EthicsAssessment

# Get regulatory updates
regulatory_service = RegulatoryIntelligence()
updates = regulatory_service.get_regulatory_updates()

# Assess an AI system for ethics compliance
ethics_service = EthicsAssessment()
assessment = ethics_service.assess_ai_system(
    system_description="Our customer segmentation AI system uses machine learning to group customers based on purchasing behavior and demographics to optimize marketing strategies."
)

print(f"Ethics Score: {assessment['assessment']['overall_score']}/10")
```

## Architecture

The platform is built using a microservices architecture, running on AWS Fargate with the following components:

- Regulatory Intelligence Microservice
- Web Scraping & Monitoring Microservice
- Compliance Analysis Microservice
- Ethics Assessment Microservice
- Policy Management Microservice
- Reporting & Dashboard Microservice

Each microservice is containerized and can be deployed independently or as part of the complete platform using AWS Fargate for serverless container orchestration.

## AWS Fargate Deployment

This platform has been designed to run on AWS Fargate, a serverless compute engine for containers that eliminates the need to provision and manage servers. Key benefits of our Fargate architecture include:

- **Serverless Operation**: No need to provision, configure, or scale virtual machines
- **Cost Optimization**: Only pay for the resources you use when containers are running
- **Automated Scaling**: Services automatically scale based on CPU and memory utilization
- **Simplified Management**: No Kubernetes cluster to maintain or manage
- **Security**: Isolated workloads running with IAM roles for fine-grained access control

For deployment instructions, see the [SETUP.md](./SETUP.md) file.

## Integration with AWS Services

The platform leverages various AWS services:

- **AWS Bedrock**: For reasoning and AI ethics analysis
- **AWS Comprehend**: For entity and document analysis
- **Amazon Kendra**: For knowledge base and search capabilities
- **Amazon DocumentDB**: For regulation and policy storage
- **Amazon DynamoDB**: For metadata storage
- **Amazon OpenSearch**: For full-text search capabilities
- **AWS Lambda**: For serverless processing
- **Amazon S3**: For document storage
- **Amazon EventBridge**: For scheduling and event-driven workflows
- **AWS Fargate**: For serverless container orchestration

## Integration with AI Employee System

This platform integrates with other components of the AI Employee system:

- **Legal Platform**: Shares regulatory information and compliance requirements
- **Financial Platform**: Provides financial regulations monitoring and compliance
- **Customer Service Platform**: Ensures customer interactions follow compliance guidelines
