# AI Financial Platform Integration

This directory contains the core components for integrating the AI Financial Platform with the AI Employee system.

## Overview

The AI Financial Platform provides advanced financial functionality powered by AWS AI services, enabling financial data processing, analysis, forecasting, risk assessment, and transaction management. It helps organizations gain insights from financial data, make informed decisions, and plan for the future.

## Features

- **Financial Data Processing**: Ingest, normalize, and process financial data from various sources
- **Financial Analysis**: Analyze financial statements and cash flow to generate insights
- **Financial Forecasting**: Generate projections and run what-if scenarios
- **Risk Assessment**: Evaluate financial risks and check regulatory compliance
- **Transaction Management**: Process, categorize, and analyze financial transactions

## Components

- **integration.py**: Core implementation of Financial Platform services:
  - `FinancialDataProcessor`: Handles ingestion and processing of financial data
  - `FinancialAnalyzer`: Analyzes financial data and generates insights
  - `FinancialForecaster`: Generates financial projections and what-if scenarios
  - `RiskAssessment`: Evaluates financial risks and compliance
  - `TransactionManager`: Manages financial transactions

## Deployment Architecture

The Financial Platform is deployed using AWS Fargate, a serverless compute engine for containers:

- **AWS Fargate**: Manages containerized microservices without requiring server management
- **Amazon ECS**: Orchestrates containers running on Fargate
- **Application Load Balancer**: Routes traffic to the appropriate microservice
- **Amazon ECR**: Stores Docker container images
- **AWS Systems Manager Parameter Store**: Manages configuration and secrets
- **AWS CloudWatch**: Provides logging, metrics, and alarms
- **Auto-scaling**: Dynamically adjusts capacity based on load

## Integration with AI Employee

The Financial Platform integrates with the AI Employee through the `financial_platform_handler.py` file in the root directory, which maps Lex intents to Financial Platform functionality:

| Intent | Function | Description |
|--------|----------|-------------|
| `ProcessFinancialData` | `handle_financial_data_processing` | Process financial data (transactions, statements, metrics) |
| `AnalyzeFinancialData` | `handle_financial_analysis` | Analyze financial statements and cash flow |
| `ForecastFinancialData` | `handle_financial_forecast` | Generate financial forecasts (cash flow, revenue) |
| `RunWhatIfScenario` | `handle_whatif_scenario` | Run what-if analysis on forecasts |
| `AssessFinancialRisk` | `handle_risk_assessment` | Assess financial risks |
| `GetTransactionAnalytics` | `handle_transaction_analytics` | Get analytics for transactions |

## Required AWS Services

- **Amazon Bedrock**: For financial analysis and insights
- **Amazon SageMaker**: For financial forecasting models
- **Amazon S3**: For data storage
- **Amazon DynamoDB**: For metadata storage
- **Amazon RDS**: For transactional data storage
- **Amazon Timestream**: For time-series financial data
- **Amazon QuickSight**: For financial visualizations
- **AWS Forecast**: For automated time-series forecasting
- **AWS Glue**: For ETL processes
- **AWS Fargate**: For serverless container execution
- **Amazon ECS**: For container orchestration
- **Amazon ECR**: For container image storage
- **AWS Systems Manager**: For configuration management

## Setup

For detailed setup instructions, please see the [INSTALLATION.md](./INSTALLATION.md) file, which includes:

1. Building Docker images for each microservice
2. Pushing images to Amazon ECR
3. Deploying the AWS CloudFormation stack for Fargate
4. Configuring environment variables and secrets
5. Setting up monitoring and logging
6. Integrating with the AI Employee

## Usage

### Processing Financial Data

```
User: "Process financial data"
AI: "What type of financial data do you want to process? (transactions, statements, metrics)"
User: "Transactions"
AI: "Successfully processed 3 transactions records. Your dataset ID is transactions-1637582946.123. You can now analyze this data or generate forecasts."
```

### Analyzing Financial Data

```
User: "Analyze financial statements for dataset-1637582946.123"
AI: [Returns financial analysis including metrics, trends, strengths/concerns, and recommendations]
```

### Generating Financial Forecasts

```
User: "Forecast cash flow for the next 12 months using dataset-1637582946.123"
AI: [Returns cash flow forecast with key metrics and trends]
```

### Running What-If Scenarios

```
User: "Run a what-if scenario on forecast-1637582946.123 with revenue impact of 15%"
AI: [Returns comparison between base forecast and scenario with recommendations]
```

### Assessing Financial Risk

```
User: "Assess financial risk for dataset-1637582946.123"
AI: [Returns comprehensive risk assessment with overall score, risk categories, and recommendations]
```

### Getting Transaction Analytics

```
User: "Show me transaction analytics for the last 30 days"
AI: [Returns transaction summary, category breakdown, and insights]
```

## Security and Data Privacy

- All financial data is encrypted at rest using AWS KMS
- DynamoDB tables are encrypted using AWS owned keys
- TLS 1.3 required for all communications
- IAM roles follow least privilege principle
- Container security best practices implemented
- Secrets stored securely in AWS Systems Manager Parameter Store
- Network traffic controlled with security groups

## Error Handling

The platform implements comprehensive error handling:

- Data processing errors are logged and reported to the user
- Analysis failures include specific error messages
- Network and service disruptions are gracefully handled
- Container health checks monitor application availability
- CloudWatch alarms alert on application issues

## Extending the Platform

To add new capabilities:

1. Add new methods to the appropriate class in `integration.py`
2. Create new handler functions in `financial_platform_handler.py`
3. Add new intents to the Lex bot and update the main orchestrator
4. Update the CloudFormation template if needed
5. Build and deploy new container images

## Reference Architecture

The Financial Platform follows a modern microservices architecture with these key components:

- Data Processing: Handles ingestion and transformation
- Analysis Engine: Delivers insights using ML models
- Forecasting Engine: Generates projections and scenarios
- Risk Management: Assesses and monitors financial risks
- Transaction Processing: Manages financial transactions

Each component runs as a separate containerized microservice on AWS Fargate, with auto-scaling, load balancing, and health monitoring.
