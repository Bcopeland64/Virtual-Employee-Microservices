# Legal Platform User Guide

This guide provides detailed instructions for using the AI Legal Platform running on AWS Fargate.

## Overview

The AI Legal Platform provides a comprehensive suite of AI-powered legal services, including document analysis, contract review, and compliance monitoring. The platform is built on a serverless architecture using AWS Fargate to provide scalable, efficient services without the operational overhead of managing servers.

## Architecture

The Legal Platform consists of three primary microservices:

1. **Document Processing Service** - Handles document ingestion, OCR, and text extraction
2. **Legal Analysis Service** - Analyzes contracts, agreements, and legal documents
3. **Compliance Monitoring Service** - Tracks and reports on regulatory compliance

## Accessing the Platform

The platform can be accessed through the following endpoints:

```
https://<load-balancer-dns>/document-processor/
https://<load-balancer-dns>/legal-analyzer/
https://<load-balancer-dns>/compliance-monitor/
```

Replace `<load-balancer-dns>` with the DNS name of your Application Load Balancer, or your custom domain if configured.

## Authentication

All API requests must be authenticated using AWS IAM credentials. The platform uses AWS Signature Version 4 for request signing.

Example using Python:

```python
import boto3
import requests
from requests_aws4auth import AWS4Auth

region = 'us-east-1'
service = 'execute-api'

credentials = boto3.Session().get_credentials()
auth = AWS4Auth(
    credentials.access_key,
    credentials.secret_key,
    region,
    service,
    session_token=credentials.token
)

response = requests.get(
    'https://legal-platform.example.com/document-processor/documents',
    auth=auth
)
```

## Python SDK

For simplified integration, you can use our Python SDK:

```python
from legal_platform import LegalPlatformClient

# Initialize the client
client = LegalPlatformClient(
    base_url="https://legal-platform.example.com",
    region="us-east-1"
)

# Upload a document
document_id = client.document_processor.upload_document(
    file_path="contract.pdf",
    metadata={"document_type": "contract", "confidentiality": "high"}
)

# Analyze a contract
analysis_id = client.legal_analyzer.analyze_contract(
    document_id=document_id,
    analysis_type="full",
    focus_areas=["obligations", "termination", "liability"]
)

# Poll for analysis completion
while True:
    result = client.legal_analyzer.get_analysis_results(analysis_id)
    if result["status"] == "completed":
        break
    time.sleep(5)

# Register for compliance monitoring
registration_id = client.compliance_monitor.register_regulation(
    regulation_name="GDPR",
    jurisdiction="European Union",
    categories=["data_privacy", "consumer_rights"]
)

# Get regulatory updates
updates = client.compliance_monitor.get_regulatory_updates(
    since="2025-02-19T00:00:00Z"
)
```

## AWS Console Access

To monitor and manage the platform through the AWS Console:

1. **ECS Console**: View and manage Fargate services
   - Navigate to Amazon ECS > Clusters > legal-platform-cluster
   - View services, tasks, and deployment status

2. **CloudWatch**: Monitor performance metrics and logs
   - Navigate to CloudWatch > Dashboards > LegalPlatformDashboard
   - View service metrics, logs, and alarms

3. **S3 Console**: Access document storage
   - Navigate to S3 > legal-document-storage
   - Browse and download stored documents

## Integration with Other Systems

### Webhook Notifications

You can register webhooks to receive notifications about document processing, analysis completions, and regulatory updates:

```
POST /document-processor/webhooks
```

Request Body:
```json
{
  "callback_url": "https://your-system.example.com/webhooks/legal-platform",
  "events": ["document.processed", "analysis.completed", "regulation.updated"],
  "secret": "your-webhook-secret"
}
```

### Email Notifications

Configure email notifications for important events:

```
POST /compliance-monitor/notifications/email
```

Request Body:
```json
{
  "email": "legal@example.com",
  "events": ["high_risk_clause_detected", "regulatory_update"],
  "frequency": "immediate"
}
```

## Best Practices

### Document Processing

1. **File Types**: The platform supports PDF, DOCX, DOC, and TXT formats. For best OCR results, use PDF files.
2. **File Size**: Keep document sizes under 20MB for optimal processing speed.
3. **Metadata**: Include detailed metadata with uploads to improve analysis accuracy.

### Legal Analysis

1. **Focus Areas**: Specify relevant focus areas to get more targeted analysis results.
2. **Custom Dictionaries**: For industry-specific terminology, provide custom dictionaries.
3. **Baseline Comparison**: Use the comparison feature to identify deviations from standard templates.

### Compliance Monitoring

1. **Regular Checks**: Set up weekly checks for critical regulations.
2. **Filtering**: Use categories and jurisdictions to filter updates for relevance.
3. **Notification Routing**: Configure different notification endpoints for different regulation types.

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **Document Processing Errors**:
   - Ensure the document is not password protected
   - Check if the file format is supported
   - Verify the file is not corrupted

2. **Authentication Failures**:
   - Verify AWS IAM credentials are correct and have necessary permissions
   - Check that your system clock is synchronized
   - Ensure the AWS Signature Version 4 signing process is correct

3. **Performance Issues**:
   - For large documents, consider splitting them into smaller files
   - Use batch processing for multiple documents
   - Schedule processing during off-peak hours

### Support

For additional support:

1. Check CloudWatch logs for detailed error information
2. Contact the support team at legal-platform-support@example.com
3. Submit a support ticket through the internal ticketing system

## Security

The Legal Platform implements several security measures:

1. **Data Encryption**: All data is encrypted in transit and at rest
2. **Access Control**: IAM roles with least privilege principle
3. **Audit Logging**: All API calls are logged for audit purposes
4. **Document Security**: Access to documents is controlled by IAM policies

## Maintenance Schedule

The platform undergoes regular maintenance:

- **Weekly**: Security patches and minor updates (no downtime)
- **Monthly**: Feature updates (scheduled maintenance window: Sundays, 2:00-4:00 AM EST)
- **Quarterly**: Major version updates (announced 2 weeks in advance)
